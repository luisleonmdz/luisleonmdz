I'm a Data Scientist with a background in audio engineering and media production, now focused on solving real-world problems through data. I bring together creative thinking and analytical skills to explore data, build predictive models, and communicate insights clearly.

🔍 I work with:
- **Python** for data manipulation and machine learning  
- **SQL** for querying and managing relational databases  
- **Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** for model building and data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for presenting technical work  

📊 I’m passionate about uncovering insights, automating decisions, and constantly learning new tools and techniques in the data ecosystem.

🌍 Bilingual (Spanish & English), also learning French and Japanese.  
🎓 Currently completing a Data Science Bootcamp @TripleTen.  
📈 Open to entry-level roles, internships, and collaboration on data-driven projects.

Let’s connect and build something great with data!
